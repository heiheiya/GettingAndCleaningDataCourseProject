This is Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

The purpose is creating a new tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from the raw data.

The data set is download from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

In the script run_analysis.R, I

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

4.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

You can find more information about the data in CodeBook.md.

Run run_analysis.R or source it. It will generate a text file named "tidtData.txt". This is the required data set.
